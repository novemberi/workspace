## Fira Code
The Fira Code is really awesome font.<br>
It supports such a lot ligatures and it looks so cool.<br>
And you can customize font options for how that looks you want.<br>
My settings is `'ss01', 'ss03', 'ss04', 'ss05', 'zero'`.<br>
You can check more options in [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
